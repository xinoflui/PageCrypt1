## PageCrypt - Password Protect HTML ##

### Overview ###

This tool lets you securely password-protect an HTML file. Unlike other password-protection tools, this tool:

1. Has no server-side components (this tool and its password-protected pages run entirely in javascript).

2. Uses strong encryption, so the password-protection cannot be bypassed.

For details and to use the tool, please see the [Project Page](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/pagecrypt/).
